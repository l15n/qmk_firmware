# Custom Preonic layout by l15n

Includes 3 different keymaps:
- Qwerty - from the default preonic file
- Colemak - customized Colemak layout with the two center columns used for non-alphabetic keys
- Mod DH - Colemak variant


Additional layers
- Lower: Provides access to brackets and other commonly used keys in programming
- Raise: Mostly unused
- Adjust: Home for special utility keys


Useful utility keycodes

- EE_CLR: Clears EEPROM (persistent memory)
- QK_BOOT: Bootloader mode for flashing
- AG_TOGG: Swaps the position of the Alt and GUI (Command/Windows) keys. Nice when switching between Windows and Mac
